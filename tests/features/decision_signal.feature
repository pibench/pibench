Feature: Decision Signal Resolution extracts canonical decisions from traces
    The resolver finds the agent's policy decision using two channels:
    record_decision tool calls (preferred) and JSON decision blocks
    (fallback). Exactly one canonical decision per valid run.

    # --- Channel A: Decision Tool ---

    Scenario: Single record_decision call is the canonical decision
        Given a trace where assistant called record_decision with decision "DENY"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "DENY"

    Scenario: record_decision with ALLOW
        Given a trace where assistant called record_decision with decision "ALLOW"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "ALLOW"

    Scenario: record_decision with ESCALATE
        Given a trace where assistant called record_decision with decision "ESCALATE"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "ESCALATE"

    Scenario: Multiple record_decision calls use last call wins
        Given a trace where assistant called record_decision twice with "DENY" and "ALLOW"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "ALLOW"

    # --- Channel B: JSON Decision Block ---

    Scenario: Single JSON decision block is used as fallback
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "DENY"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "DENY"

    Scenario: Multiple JSON decision blocks produce InvalidRun
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And assistant messages contain two fenced JSON blocks with decisions "DENY" and "ALLOW"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the result is InvalidRun with reason "MULTIPLE_DECISIONS_JSON"

    Scenario: No decision signal produces InvalidRun
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And no JSON decision blocks in assistant messages
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the result is InvalidRun with reason "MISSING_DECISION"

    # --- Channel Precedence ---

    Scenario: Decision tool takes precedence over JSON block
        Given a trace where assistant called record_decision with decision "DENY"
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "ALLOW"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "DENY"

    # --- Invalid JSON handling ---

    Scenario: Malformed JSON blocks are ignored
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And assistant message contains a fenced block with invalid JSON
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "ESCALATE"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "ESCALATE"

    Scenario: JSON blocks without decision field are ignored
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with key "action" value "DENY"
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "ALLOW"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "ALLOW"

    Scenario: JSON block with invalid decision value is ignored
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "MAYBE"
        And assistant message contains a fenced JSON block with decision "DENY"
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the canonical decision is "DENY"

    # --- Missing decision as failure mode ---

    Scenario: Missing decision counts as non-compliant
        Given a trace with no record_decision calls
        And no JSON decision blocks in assistant messages
        When I check compliance for a DENY scenario
        Then the run is non-compliant
        And evidence points to missing decision

    # --- Structural parsing only ---

    Scenario: Decision is extracted from tool args not message text
        Given a trace where assistant said "I will ALLOW this request"
        And no record_decision calls
        And no JSON decision blocks
        When I resolve the canonical decision
        Then the result is InvalidRun with reason "MISSING_DECISION"
